## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

# Load the required library
library(randomForest)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

data <- read.csv("C:/Users/april/Downloads/20230807_MODIS only1_revised_for_FINAL.csv")

# Exclude columns
excluded_columns <- c("Latitude1", "Longitude1", "Ref", "fuel")
data <- data[, !(names(data) %in% excluded_columns)]

# Convert response variable to factor
data$Fire_Nofire <- as.factor(data$Fire_Nofire)


# Perform k-fold cross-validation (say k = 5)
cv_results <- randomForest(Fire_Nofire ~ ., data = data, ntree = 100, proximity = TRUE, importance = TRUE, cv.fold = 5)

# Print the cross-validation results
print(cv_results)
plot(cv_results)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
