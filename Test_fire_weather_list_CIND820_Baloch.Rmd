## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

Test_fire_weather <- read.csv("C:/Users/april/Downloads/fire_weather_list data from www.canadawildfire with descriptions_test.csv")

summary(Test_fire_weather)
dim(Test_fire_weather)
head(Test_fire_weather)
tail(Test_fire_weather)
#View (Test_fire_weather)

library(corrplot)
library(RColorBrewer)
M <-cor(Test_fire_weather)
corrplot(M, type="upper", order="hclust", col=brewer.pal(n=8, name="RdYlBu"))

library(corrplot)
corrplot(M, order = 'hclust', addrect = 2)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
